# Smart-Urban-Greenifier
Smart Urban Greenifier 🌿


# Description
Smart Urban Greenifier is a project aimed at promoting urban sustainability through nature-based solutions, using data science to identify, design, and optimize green spaces in urban environments. The project focuses on analyzing and managing green areas intelligently to improve the quality of life in cities and address environmental challenges such as pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss.

# Objectives

- Analyze the impact of nature-based solutions on urban ecosystems.
- Use data science techniques to optimize the distribution and design of green spaces.
- Create predictive models for plant growth and the effectiveness of green solutions in urban areas.
- Support cities in adopting sustainable urban regeneration strategies.
  
# 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python: For data analysis and building predictive models.
- Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and processing.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and predictions.
- Geopandas: For spatial analysis and managing geospatial data.
- TensorFlow: For potential deep learning models.
- Folium: For visualizing geospatial data on interactive maps.
